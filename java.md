# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

#### Your answer:  
1: modifiers   
2: return type (can be void(no return) or any variable)
3: name of the method   
4: parameter data type
5: parameter name
6: declaration of a variable
7: body of the method
8: return statement

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
Constructors are used to create objects of a certain class. They can be empty (no parameters given) or they can have parameters.
If not given any other contructor with at least one paramenter, every class has a default empty constructor. It is possible, to use more constructors for the same objects, with different parameters.
